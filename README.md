change color (red, green, blue) and background color.
have two shapes
learnt stroke is the frame color of the shape
fill the color for the shape
createCanvas(length, width)
console.log(x) gives you the informations
if(x < 0) if for the condition
I tried to use different shape (circle), which only need to consider about (x, y and diameter)
Ans for explore more, instead of just make the shape moving panï¼Œ I tried to make the circle to move tilt
I was trying to make two circle move to differet direction but seems quite hard I haven't figure out how to do it.
