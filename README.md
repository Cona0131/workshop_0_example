change color (255, 255, 255) and background color.
have two shapes
I tried to use different shape (circle), which only need to consider about (x, y and diameter)
Ans for explore more, instead of just make the shape moving panï¼Œ I tried to make the circle to move tilt
I was trying to make two circle move to differet direction but seems quite hard I haven't figure out how to do it.
